    "Ever run an AB test in which not all users in the treatment group actually received the treatment?  As in, you pull a sample from your user base, you split it into treatment and control, you intend to give the treatment to all of the users in the treatment group, and give no treatment to users in the control group, but for one reason or another, not all users in the treatment group actually received the treatment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never had to worry about this, great!  But you might be thinking, how would this even happen?  Well, imagine you work on an app or a webpage and you and a team want to test a new feature.  This feature is not in plain view as soon as a user visits your page, so the user would have to navigate in order to see it.  Now, when designing the experiment you pull a sample of users, and you randomly divide this sample into A and B, control and treatment.  All that is left to do is to wait for the users to log in to the webpage and, hopefully, navigate to the section of your webpage with the test feature.  But, because the feature is out-of-focus intially, only some users in the treatment group will ever navigate to the point on the page on which the feature is located.  In other words, some of your treatment group will remain untreated because they will never reach that section of the page to see your test feature.  What do you do?  Luckily, this type of issue is common in randomized controlled trials where it is known as *noncompliance*.  For example, medical researchers that are testing a new drug cannot always *force* an individual to take their medication, so inevitably some users in the experimental group will not comply.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This post focuses on one-sided noncompliance -- if you assign some users to a treatment group, but some manage to remain untreated.  Two-sided noncompliance exists -- when some users in the control group manage to get access to the experimental treatment -- but in the case of an AB test that a data scientist would be involved in, is much less-likely to occur.  In any case, the analysis is the same, but the assumptions become slightly stronger in the two-sided case.  "

    "The potential outcomes framework provides the theoretical justification for randomized controlled experiments as a means of determining causality.  In effect, it underpins all AB testing.  We're going to use it here to demonstrate the effects of noncompliance, and how we can still obtain valid causal estimates in the presence of noncompliance.  \n",

    "Before we run any AB test we can think of each user in our sample as having two theoretical states; the user can be assigned to the treatment group, in which case they will be given the experimental treatment, or they can be assigned to the control group, in which case they are not given the treatment.  Each individual in the sample therefore has a 'treated state' and an 'untreated state'.  Naturally, one can never observe an individual in both the treated state and untreated state at the same time (this is known as the fundamental problem of causal inference).  But, given random assignment, we can aggregate and observe groups in both states simultaneously.  We're going to use this framework in the simulations throughout this post.  \n",

Using our webpage example, if we imagine that y is a measure of page engagment, defining compliance in this manner is analagous to saying that only those that are highly engaged will see our experimental feature.  This is of course a simplified example, but it makes intuitive sense; if the feature is deep in the webpage somewhere, we'd only expect highly engaged users to spend enough time on the page to come across it.  Naturally, in real-world cases the determinants of compliance will be much more complex, but this simple example is sufficient to demonstrate the issue with noncompliance.\n",

    "So when we have noncompliance we can obtain the complier average causal effect by scaling the intent to treat effect by the proportion of the treated that complied.  But does this mean that our results cannot be generalized to the wider population? Of course, that's exactly what this means!  With systematic noncompliance, the complier average causal effect cannot be generalized to noncompliers as well because these two groups have different potential outcomes.  Noncompliers were never treated, so in effect no experiment was run with their involvement... And you can never generalize to a group that was unrepresented in any experiment.  The inclusion of noncompliers in the sample doesn't change that.  Sometimes, such as the new feature on a deep section of a webpage, that is exactly what you want -- you only want an estimate of the effect of the feature on users that will actually see said feature. And sometimes the CACE is not exactly what you want, but is the best you can get.  In either case, be aware that with noncompliance your results only generalize to compliers.  "
